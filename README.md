# General information
1) Before you can start the analysis, you need to download gene expression data from
the Allen Human Brain Atlas. You can do this with the MATLAB
scripts run_download_AHBA.m provided in MATLAB_DATA_DOWNLOAD. Before you can run this file,
you need to download  parse_json.m from https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/20565-json-parser 
and copy it to this folder MATLAB_DATA_DOWNLOAD. Then you just need to run run_download_AMBA_AHBA.m , which can
take several hours or up to days.
We also provide the output of this analysis at storage/all_genes_expression_Human.mat, storage/atlasRegionsHuman.mat and storage/ontologyHuman.json

2) For the analysis, also taskFMRI network data from the Human Connectome Project is needed. The task data is available
at the 900 Subjects Data Release  https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult/document/900-subjects-data-release).
The task fMRI data HCP_S900_787_tfMRI_ALLTASKS_level3_zstat1_hp200_s2_MSMAll.dscalar.nii needs to be copied to the storage folder.
It can be converted to biopsy-site level (raw data is on cortical surface level) with generateTaskFMRIDataOnBiopsyLevel.m 
in MATLAB_DATA_DOWNLOAD. Note that this script  requires the human connectome project workbench 
from http://www.humanconnectome.org/software/connectome-workbench.html
We also provide the output of this analysis at storage/taskfMRI.mat

3) Analysis can be performed with the files in R_MAIN_CODE. It contains a R notebook (COMPUTATIONAL_NEUROANATOMY.Rmd) that
generates the figures from the paper step-by-step provided with comments (with R version 4.0.3). The analysis requires the prediction of functional
neuroanatomical maps with updated code from a previous publication Ganglberger et al [1]. It can be found also in this folder
(predict_human_expression_synergy.R and predict_mouse_expression_synergy) and will be automatically called in the R notebook.
After performing the analysis, subspace patternmining with biclustering (GABi) can be performed with GABI_BICLUSTERING.R. 
Please note that for this pattern mining can take several days to weeks without an HPC environment.
